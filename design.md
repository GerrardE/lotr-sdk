# Design

This project has been designed bearing readability, simplicity and scalability in mind. The `domain` layer bears all necessary interfaces, the `factory` contains functions for returning mock objects for testing, the `logic` layer houses all the core logic functions.

# CICD

The cicd for this project has been setup using Github Actions. However due to the fact that this is a private repository, I cannot access the environment variables to set the secrets required to achieve a successful testing.
